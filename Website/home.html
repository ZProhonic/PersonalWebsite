                <h2>Software Development</h2>
                <p>I am a current student at Grand Circus' fullstack C# development bootcamp. Throughout the course, i
                    have learned C# backend structure, SQL, and web development. As i continue to learn and grow, i hope
                    to create my own web applications and secure a position in the software development field. </p>

                <h2>Location</h2>
                <p>I am originally from central Pennsylvania, and relocated to the Charlotte metro area after graduating
                    from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. I graduated high school with roughly 100 other students, so
                    living near a big city is a wonderful change of pace!</p>
