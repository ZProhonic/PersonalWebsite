                <p>Throughout my education at Grand Circus, i have completed many projects utilizing many aspects of
                    programming. Below, you can find some of my favorites that highlight my progress throughout the past
                    few months.</p>

                <p>During my course pre-work, i was instructed to create a coin flip game. This application asks the
                    user to select heads or tails and tells them if their guess matches the random flip of the coin.
                    There are 5 rounds.</p>

                <p>Rock, paper, scissors is a game in which the user can play against mutliple opponents of their
                    selection. Each round, the application will let the user if they won and give them a few options to
                    proceed.</p>
