                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>My passion for technology has fueled my journey into software development, where I find joy in creating and innovating. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems and building efficient, scalable solutions. Software development isn't just a career for me; it's a way to continuously learn and grow in a field that's constantly evolving.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not immersed in code, I love spending time in the great outdoors, whether it's fishing in a lake or hiking through the trails. Fishing is a way for me to unwind and connect with nature, while hiking allows me to explore new places and stay active. I'm always up for trying new foods, and I enjoy discovering hidden culinary gems, especially during my trips to Asheville, NC. The city’s vibrant food scene never fails to surprise me, offering everything from artisanal cheeses to exotic street foods.</p>

                    <p>I value quality time with friends and family, and I'm always ready for a weekend getaway to explore new places or just relax with loved ones. Video games have been a lifelong interest of mine, sparking my curiosity and creativity since childhood. Whether it’s playing the latest RPG or revisiting classic titles, I find that games are a great way to unwind and challenge my strategic thinking.</p>

                    <p>Rachel, my fiancé, has been a constant source of love and support throughout my journey. I’m incredibly grateful for her presence in my life, and we share many adventures together, from weekend road trips to cozy nights in. Our two dogs, Oakley and Akira, and our cat, Milo, add so much joy to our home. Oakley and Akira are always up for a walk, while Milo loves to keep us company, often curling up next to me as I work or play.</p>

                    <p>In addition to my love for technology and the outdoors, I have a deep passion for music. Playing the guitar has been a part of my life for years. Music, like coding, is a creative outlet that allows me to express myself and connect with others.</p>

                    <p>Overall, my life is a blend of coding, adventure, and creativity. Whether I'm developing a new app, exploring a mountain trail, experimenting with new recipes, or strumming a guitar, I’m always driven by a passion for discovery and a love for the journey.</p>
